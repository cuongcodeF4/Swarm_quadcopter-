Usage:
------
The output generated by `csvCreator.py` can be utilized in the `offboard_from_csv.py` file, also available in the same GitHub repository, to control a drone in an offboard mode. The generated CSV file contains the necessary information for each step of the drone's trajectory, including position, velocity, acceleration, yaw angle, and LED colors.

Offboard Control in PX4:
------------------------
The offboard mode in PX4 is a flight mode that allows external systems to control the drone's position and velocity directly. It enables autonomous flight and is commonly used in research, development, and testing scenarios. The offboard control system communicates with the drone's flight controller through a communication protocol like MAVLink.

To use the CSV output generated by `csvCreator.py` for offboard control in PX4, you can follow these steps:
1. Load the generated CSV file, which represents the desired trajectory for the drone.
2. Extract the position and velocity information from the CSV file.
3. Send the position and velocity commands to the drone's flight controller using an offboard control system, such as the `offboard_from_csv.py` script.
4. The flight controller will interpret the commands and execute the desired trajectory, guiding the drone accordingly.

CSV File Structure and Guide:
----------------------------
The CSV file created by `csvCreator.py` follows a specific structure, where each row represents a step of the drone's trajectory. The columns in the CSV file contain the following information:
- `idx`: Index or step number of the trajectory.
- `t`: Time in seconds for the given step.
- `px`: Drone's position in the X-axis.
- `py`: Drone's position in the Y-axis.
- `pz`: Drone's position in the Z-axis (negative value indicates altitude).
- `vx`: Drone's velocity in the X-axis.
- `vy`: Drone's velocity in the Y-axis.
- `vz`: Drone's velocity in the Z-axis.
- `ax`: Drone's acceleration in the X-axis.
- `ay`: Drone's acceleration in the Y-axis.
- `az`: Drone's acceleration in the Z-axis.
- `yaw`: Drone's yaw angle.
- `ledr`: Red component value for the drone's LED color.
- `ledg`: Green component value for the drone's LED color.
- `ledb`: Blue component value for the drone's LED color.

To create a valid CSV file for offboard control, make sure to adhere to the structure described above. Each row should represent a specific time step with the corresponding position, velocity, acceleration, and LED color values.


Function: create_active_csv()

Description:
-------------
The create_active_csv() function in csvCreator.py is responsible for generating the CSV file that represents the drone's trajectory. This function accepts several input parameters to customize the trajectory generation process.

Usage:
------
To use the create_active_csv() function, call it with the desired input parameters to generate the CSV file for the drone's trajectory.

Args:
-----
- shape_name (str): Name of the shape to be flown by the drone. Available options:
    - "circle": Drone will fly in a circular path.
    - "square": Drone will fly in a square path.
    - "triangle": Drone will fly in a triangular path.
    - "custom": Drone will follow a user-defined path.
- diameter (float): Diameter of the shape in meters. Applicable to "circle" shape only.
- direction (int): Direction of the shape's traversal. Use 1 for clockwise (CW) and -1 for counterclockwise (CCW). Applicable to "circle" and "square" shapes.
- maneuver_time (float): Total time to complete one traversal of the shape in seconds.
- start_x (float): X-coordinate of the starting position.
- start_y (float): Y-coordinate of the starting position.
- initial_altitude (float): Initial altitude of the drone in meters.
- climb_rate (float): Rate of climb or descent in meters per second.
- move_speed (float): Speed of movement along the shape in meters per second.
- hold_time (float): Time to hold at each vertex of the shape in seconds.

Outputs:
--------
The create_active_csv() function generates a CSV file that represents the drone's trajectory. The CSV file contains the following columns:
- `idx`: Index or step number of the trajectory.
- `t`: Time in seconds for the given step.
- `px`: Drone's position in the X-axis.
- `py`: Drone's position in the Y-axis.
- `pz`: Drone's position in the Z-axis (negative value indicates altitude).
- `vx`: Drone's velocity in the X-axis.
- `vy`: Drone's velocity in the Y-axis.
- `vz`: Drone's velocity in the Z-axis.
- `ax`: Drone's acceleration in the X-axis.
- `ay`: Drone's acceleration in the Y-axis.
- `az`: Drone's acceleration in the Z-axis.
- `yaw`: Drone's yaw angle.
- `ledr`: Red component value for the drone's LED color.
- `ledg`: Green component value for the drone's LED color.
- `ledb`: Blue component value for the drone's LED color.

Example Usage:
--------------
To generate a CSV file for a circular trajectory, use the following code snippet:

create_active_csv(shape_name="circle", diameter=5.0, direction=1, maneuver_time=60.0, start_x=0.0, start_y=0.0, initial_altitude=10.0, climb_rate=2.0, move_speed=2.5, hold_time=2.0)

Visualization:
--------------
After generating the CSV file, you can visualize the trajectory using plot functions and save the trajectory plot in the "shaped" folder along with the CSV file.

Note:
-----
Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed and correctly set up the offboard control system to use the generated CSV file for controlling the drone in an offboard mode.
