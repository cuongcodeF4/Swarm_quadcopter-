Main problem:
     Drone Frame
          re-design or keep part of it
          what need to be fix on the Frame
          can you scale the drone
     what do master laptop Pub
          check up signal init
          check up signal in
          where do we process that
          type of command
          type of format
          how to assign formation
               base on what and why
               how to command a drone to flight to a point or multiple point
               how to do it simultaneously through out all the drone (maybe sending coordinate first and then start all)
               what type of formation
          matrix math, assign problem
          
     what do drone listening to
          command? make a list, how many type of command
               do we need to split the type of command into two type: sys command and drone command
          other drone coordinate for avoidance?
          do it need to commute with the master drone or master laptop
     drone or master laptop
     what do drone Pub
          what kind of info?
          how many time per sec?
          data pack format? how big is it?
     Pre-flight routine
          check up routine
          fail safe if needed?
